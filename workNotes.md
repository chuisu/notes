Hello [user's first name],

Your Eastman-provided computer is now eligible for an upgrade. We will be replacing your current machine with newly purchased hardware, and in order to maintain your workflow, we would like to migrate your data from your old computer to your new one. Necessarily, this may take some time, depending on the use and capacity of your hard drive. The migration process could take a maximum of 12 hours, but usually doesn't last that long; however, please be advised: during this time, you will be unable to use your computer or the data that exists on it. 

Please expect a call from us over the next couple months asking about what time would be most convenient for you to be without your computer for this period of time. 

Thank you for your continued patience while we roll out these computers.
