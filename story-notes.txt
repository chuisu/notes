stories for game devs
#Flow in games
	Expressed as diagram with challenge on y and player skill on x;
	Players are anxious if challenge is too high, bored if not
	Flow is the middle
#Tensions in stories
	Tension on y , time on x
	Many changes throughout the graph
	Like flow diagram, there can be a too tense, and too boring
#What is the story?
	Made up into Pre-authored content (like a maze), and players (who interpret the maze)
	These two things create the player experience, which is the place between anxiety and boredom in games
#Basics of storytelling
	#Motivations
		*external (desire to change the world) and *internal (desire to change the self (overcoming a block)) for characters
		internal can also be learning something new (this is usually something they should have already known)
		Both mean that stories are about change. Change must happen!
	#Plot structure
		Player has goal
		Start your story before the big events begin
			Story starts with everyday life before Harry becomes a wizard
			(something like a tutorial mission)
			Important to build empathy with character; player must want the character to overcome the struggles ahead
		Inciting incident
			Now that place in the world is set, challenges can be set up
			Increase tension (mechanically, narratively)
			Add enemies, risk, or break in usual situation
