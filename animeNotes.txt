Frame Arms Girl

"why don't you fly too?" what, why does this reduce hp to 0
Main character is supposed to be relatable but ends up being unlikeable
	Lazy, doesn't want to read through emails, doesn't want to build the armor
	Curious to see about character growth
	Shouldn't the character be likeable to be relatable?
	Shows traits of kindness, but these are superseded by her laziness and are understated
	
Main Arms girl lacks charm
	We don't know much about her, and she is not nailed down as a character
3D animation still has to grow
Should feel like "toy story"?
Provides insight into a niche that i wouldn't get to see usually
Widely charactered show doesn't capitalize on depth of character
We never learn about who these people are, really, only their interactions with one another
	only character with depth seems to be Sty-Ko, who wants to beat Gourai. Is this the only impetus?
This anime is missing a lot. It's hard to iterate what isn't there, but here's a shot
	There are no consequences, and no actions feel like they have weight.
	It doesn't feel like we ever leave the same couple places.
	Nothing feels like it matters!!
		There is no overarching plot?
		The characters don't make us feel like we are rooting for them toward anything?
		The antagonists don't turn out to be antagonists
		They make light of stylet's trauma when she can't fly
Gourai kissed stylet what that doesn't make sense at all plot-wise, what motivations does she even have
	This is a reflection of what kind of a character Gourai is, but it doesn't make sense
	In the end, the impact is totally negated since she doesn't remember what actually happened.
