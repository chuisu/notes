# Security
	Multi-layered approach to security, meaning that security is designed into the fabric of everything
	# Built-in security features
		# *Sandboxing: prevents hackers from harming your programs, restricting:
			Actions that programs can perform on your Mac
			Files that programs can access
			Programs that can be launched
		# *Systen Integrity Protection: prevents potentially malicious software from modifying protected files and folder
			SIP protects:
				/System; /usr; /bin; /sbin
			SIP allows third party installers to write to:
				/Applications; /Library; /usr/local
			Only processes signed by apple AND have entitlements to modify these folders can do so (eg Apple software and Apple installers)
			Apps from the App store already work with SIP
			SIP prevents software from changing startup volume
		# *Library randomization: keeps malicious commands from finding their targets
		# *Execute Disable: protects the memory in your Mac from attacks
	# Creating strong passwords
		Passwords are considered strong when they have at least:
			eight characters
			one uppercase and one lowercase letter
			one number
			one punctuation mark or symbol
		*Password Assistant: checks your password strength or generates a strong password for you
			Password types include:
				Manual--enter a password; pass is rated, if too weak, tips are offered
				Memorable--adjust password length setting; generates list of passwords containing words and some random characters
					eg. wept1]puller
				Letters & Numbers--adjust password length setting; generates list of passwords with a combination of letters and numbers
					eg. tSFCF4ILh2yc
				Numbers Only--adjust password length setting; generates list of passwords with only numbers
					eg. 007515850186
				Random--adjust password length setting; generates list of passwords containing random characters
					eg. )RO{AJKTDc\0
