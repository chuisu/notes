Asset tracking needs to happen asap!
Filemaker could help, we could look up an open source asset tracking or database tool

Or we could make our own tool with sql

to be done with Jira (IT'S HAPPENING)
ops doc:
Setup asset tracking system in Jira (easy part)
Setup email address to receive asset emails from remote users (all users)
Send company-wide email instructing users on how to find important, need-to-be-tracked pieces of info
Cross check against list of AD computers, cross off each computer when all info is known about it
If computers are missing, find out why
