Could have gitlab with organized, tagged folders

Folders would have tags according to each item, easily searchable.

Gitlab may not be the best way to do this;
would be nice to be able to tag each article
Confluence would be a great way to do this

May look simple in django
Django app overview:
App documentation
  Model document:
    attribs:
      title
      body
      tags
      upload
      etc
  Template:
    Would provide simple, search-engine feeling page on surface
      Search by tags, title, etc
    Needs page that organizes articles by tags, other organizational details (folders?)
    document detail page provides more info, related documents, etc

Docusaurus looks good as well.
