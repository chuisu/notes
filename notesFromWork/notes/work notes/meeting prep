  Things are going well; learning a lot about the company's processes and applying that knowledge through solution of tickets.
  Have solved tickets ranging from mailbox and user creation to shipping out machines
  There are some positive changes that could be made to improve some aspects of operations (at least from my end)
    Documentation:
      if there's a mark at all that I would like to leave, it's the centralization and compilation of the documentation that we have
      there are some holes in the knowledge that I have been compiling as plaintext on my computer, and these would prove very helpful in a place like Confluence
      also necessary considering the nature of employment here, and how lots of short term workers seem to work here
    Asset tracking:
      Asset tracking is essential.
      FileMaker is a good option, or there are some open source options we could explore
      I could even create a DB.
      It is just not centralized, and there is no definitive source of knowledge. If we needed to know the serial of a machine that we deployed (RMA, imaging, etc), a MAC address, etc, we are dead in the water if we can't remote to the computer or contact the user.
    Ticketing:
      
    GPs:
      
    Imaging process:
