After the warm handoff, I was tasked with development and logistical planning of the front end of Baillie's Jira instance. This included the following:
  End user-facing:
    coordinating colors
    icon/favicon implementation
    UI design considerations
    portal setup
  Agent facing:
    dashboard implementation
    queue setup
  System facing:
    ticket/issue importation
    mail setup
    user setup
    custom fields

Coordinating colors
Within Jira Administration (gear icon) > System > User interface > Look and feel:
Header Background Color: #ffffff
    Header background should be white
Header Highlight Background Color: #ffffff
    When items in header have focus, the background should remain the same
Header Separator Color: #c9c9c9
    Horizontal line separating header from content should be gray, closely matching system content separator color
Header Text Color: #0e1f19
    Text in header should be close to black (slightly green)
Header Text Highlight Color: #015e3d
    This is the "Baillie color" as taken from baillie.com. Items with focus in the header will get this color
Menu Item Highlight Background Color: #015e3d
    In dropdown menus, backgrounds for items with focus will have the Baillie color
Menu Item Highlight Text Color: #ffffff
    In dropdown menus, text will be white for readability on the Baillie color
Button Background Color: #006a46
    A variation of the Baillie color, buttons will be green
Button Text Color: #ffffff
    On top of the Baillie color variation, button text should be white
Link Active Color: #00a365
    When the button and other links with the Baillie color (or variations) have focus, they should turn bright green
Heading Color: #292929
    Headings should be close to black
Link Color: #015e3d
    Links should be the Baillie color

Gadget Color 1: #015e3d
    The primary gadget color should be the Baillie color

Icon/favicon implementation:
Assets were taken from www.baillie.com
    Favicon was taken from /images/favicon.png
    Icon/logo was taken from /images/bailliehrlogo.png
Within Jira Administration > System > User Interface > Look and feel:
Logo > Upload from File > upload bailliehrlogo.png
Favicon > Upload from File > upload favicon.png

UI design considerations:
The most readable configurations were those with black text on white background. There were iterations where text was white with the baillie color as the background. Though this was readable, users (especially agents) would have to read and navigate using these for hours at a time. After a while, this configuration and configurations like it would surely get exhausting. The human eye, however, is accustomed to reading black text on white. Not only does this make for a more comfortable reading experience, but the look that's achieved is quite clean and aesthetic. Implementing the Baillie color (#015e3d) as highlights in this configuration works well for branding without being overt. "Highlighted" items, in this case, comprise the following: links, items with focus, gadget headers, menu items with focus. As these items are a minority on screen real estate, such a bold color as #015e3d provides a balanced contrast. Additionally, when items have focus and gain this color, it provides power to the action that the item telegraphs, allowing the user to more intuitively navigate and use tools.

Portal setup:
The portal is our most exposed component of Jira and represents the most important part of user interaction: initial reporting. If the portal is too complicated or hard to use, users won't report through here, and not enough data can be captured by sending email alone. Therefore, it was imperative that we set up intuitive request types and categories, with the catchall option being "Get IT help." An intuitive portal would ensure no requests went unnoticed. The following are the request types and fields (the asterisk denotes a required field):

Dashboard Implementation:
Agents needed an initial area where valuable information could be found at a glance. This was implemented through Jira's dashboards, which allowed for several "gadgets" to be placed at the disgression of the administrator. I found that dashboards could be organized into two distinct entities: main and data. The "main" dashboard would include information valuable to an agent's workflow, such as a list of their assigned tickets. The "data" dashboard would include analytics that the agent could look at to judge their performance and the general health of the service desk.

Queue Setup:
Integral to an agent's workflow are reliable and well-labeled queues where useful (and sometimes critical) information can be found. 

Ticket/Issue importing:
See BLC-6 (and subtickets) and BLC-22234


Mail Setup:

User setup:
Jira was tied into Active Directory when the warm handoff occurred, so I did not need to add this external directory. If more info is required on the association of an external directory, Atlassian has the relevant resources.
My charge with user setup was to ensure that all users of BLC had the correct permissions corresponding to their interactions with the service desk. Users could be categorized into three distinct entities: service desk users, service desk agents, and service desk admins. 
Service desk users:


Custom Fields:
Many fields that suit the needs of the BLC service desk are available by default, but some needed to be added in order to fulfill our requirements from Jira. In addition to the addition and configuration of these fields, they also needed to be added to certain screens. For the most part, these just needed to be associated with the screens associated with the issue type that these correspond to, or to be widely available. The following are the custom fields provisioned for BLC.

Impact
Location
Request type
