M&T problem

What we know so far:
We have a known good computer whose settings we can replicate (default IE settings, site not in trusted but doesn't matter)
Replicating these settings on several computers has failed.
    This includes security settings, tried all different combinations of IE settings, etc.
Chrome not supported, Mozilla not supported
Firewall/antivirus have been paused, no results
IE was hard reset, no results
Java was uninstalled/reinstalled, no results
